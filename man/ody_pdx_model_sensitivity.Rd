\usage{
ody_pdx_model_sensitivity(
  data_frame,
  file_name = NULL,
  file_dir = getwd(),
  model_type = c("guess_it", "glmm", "lmm"),
  n_dec = 3,

}
\arguments{
\item{data_frame}{A data frame where:
\itemize{
\item The first column contains the PDX id's.
\item The second column is a two levels factors for sensitivity.
\item The third column is a two levels factor for treatment.
\item The fourth column is the response variable.
}}

\item{file_name}{Name of the html file. If NULL, the file is named with the date the analysis was performed, the name of the dependent variable and type of model performed.}

\item{file_dir}{Directory where the result is stored. The default is the current working directory.}

\item{model_type}{The type of model the function will run. With the default value, "guess_it", the function "guesses" the model according to the response variable. Other valid arguments are "lmm" or "glmm" to force the function to perform a LMM or a GLMM respectively.}

\item{n_dec}{Number of decimals to show in the results table.}

\item{p_adjust}{Method to correct multiple testing (see ?multcomp::adjusted for further detail on the available methods).}
}
\value{
A HTML report
}
\description{
Runs a (Generalized) Linear Mixed Model to test wether the response to a treatment depends on the sensitivity. By default, if the response is a count of positive findings over 100, the function performs a Binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Model, otherwise it runs a Linear Mixed Model.
}
\details{
The way the function decides wich model to use when model_type equals "guess_it" is very simple: If the response variable is a 0 to 100 integer (a number with no decimals), then the model is a GLMM, else, the model is a LMM.
